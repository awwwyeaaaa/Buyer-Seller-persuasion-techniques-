# Buyer-Seller-persuasion-techniques-
This repository is part of the paper "Looking for Peitho in the digital world" as part of my Undergraduate Research Opportunity (UROP) in the National University of Singapore studying persuasion techniques in buyer-seller interactions.

It uses data from the following sources: 
1. Weakly-Supervised Hierarchical Models for Predicting Persuasion Strategies by Jiaao Chen and Diyi Yang (Reddit dataset on r/ROAP and r/borrow) 
2. Decoupling Strategy and Generation in Negotiation Dialogues by He.H et al. (Craigslist Bargain dataset) 

Introduction:

Peitho, a lesser-known companion of Aphrodite, the goddess of persuasion is no less vital to civil life in Athens and Argos. Creating a democratic spirit and rousing the citizens to cooperate with her charming words and seductive methods, her myth attest to a magic that endures through the ages- the power of persuasion. 

Exchanges/buying and selling as we know it has evolved to occupy a new dimension, with modern interactions and communities existing in virtual spaces. Yet, as social beings, we cannot escape the need to apply persuasion and communication to achieve our goals. How can we implement the persuasive power of Peitho in buyer-seller interactions of the modern world, if at all?

Unlike conventional face to face bargaining that takes place, negotiations on online platforms are relatively quick (this study found that an average Craigslist Bargain comprised about 9 text messages). There is also less asymmetry of knowledge as both buyers and sellers are more easily able to research a product beforehand via the internet, levelling the knowledge gap between buyer and seller. These in turn would influence the persuasion techniques both buyers and sellers will utilize.

The persuasion techniques analyzed in this paper draws upon the Elaboration Likelihood Model as developed by Petty and Cacioppo (1986) that explains persuasion is a cognitive event. It claims that influence can take place over two main routes, the central messaging route which leverages logical reasoning while the peripheral messaging route depends more on emotional involvement of the receiver. 

This study builds upon the earlier work done in the field of computational communication to understand the types of persuasion techniques used and how computer programs are ability to mimic human negotiations. The datasets used for analysis in this paper are from Chen and Yang’s “Weakly-Supervised Hierarchical Models for Predicting Persuasion Strategies” and “Decoupling Strategy and Generation in Negotiation Dialogues” by He. H et al. The datasets would be further elaborated under section 4.Results. 

This paper aims to investigate the techniques employed by actors in buyer-seller negotiations (Craigslist Bargain dataset from He. H et al). The results will be compared to the demographic of persuasion techniques used in good faith textual requests (Reddit dataset taken from Chen and Yang). Persuasions in the contexts of good faith textual requests leverage the peripheral messaging route more as compared to buyer-seller negotiations that heavily lean on the central messaging route. Given the differences in results, the discussion will center around factors that may account for the differences in the demographic of persuasion techniques employed by actors from both datasets.
