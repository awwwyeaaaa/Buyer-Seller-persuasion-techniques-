# Buyer-Seller-persuasion-techniques-
This repository is part of the paper "Looking for Peitho in the digital world" as part of my Undergraduate Research Opportunity (UROP) in the National University of Singapore studying persuasion techniques in buyer-seller interactions.

It uses data from the following sources: 
1. Weakly-Supervised Hierarchical Models for Predicting Persuasion Strategies by Jiaao Chen and Diyi Yang (Reddit dataset on r/ROAP and r/borrow) 
2. Decoupling Strategy and Generation in Negotiation Dialogues by He.H et al. (Craigslist Bargain dataset)
